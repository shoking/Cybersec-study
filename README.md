Journey into cybersec

This is going to be a diary of my journey into cyber security

In the past i had studied for CCNA and MSCE, but long forgot most of the stuff so i'm relearning a lot of it.
Got myself a subscrition of TryHackMe and im doing the pre-security learning path at the moment.

My goal is to invest at least one hour a day on the week days and a couple of hours on the weekend's

I am almost finished with the Pre-security path, i took some notes but after finish the path ill remake some notes and try to write up something about the strugles of what was the pre-security path, i would like to write up day to day updates of the journey so i have some visibility and some sense of dutty to output work.
